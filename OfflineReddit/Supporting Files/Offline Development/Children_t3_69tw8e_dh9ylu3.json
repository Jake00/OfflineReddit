We payed for part of it with some money I've saved and financed the rest(Getting a job over the summer to help pay the rest). After we bought the car my mom texted my dad and asked him if he'd  help pay for the insurance (which is super expensive for a 16 year old male) and maybe even help pay for some of the car, my dad refuses saying my stepmom told him not to \"pay another penny unless the courts make him\". My mom gets pissed because she says it's not fair to us and starts to cry. I got upset too and go upstairs to my room later and cry alone.... To make things worse my mom is taking him to court ,and she's already paid the attorney a 5k premium she can't afford(hypothetically can since my dad is well off and is definitely making enough for a child support increase). The whole situation is giving me serious anxiety because I don't want any of this to happen and it could've been avoided if my dad had just been reasonable and negotiated. No going back now though",

My gran had died of cancer whilst I was down in London (her death was expected, and I'd still gone down to London anyway, as I know she would've wanted me to just carry on and enjoy myself regardless - plus it did kinda help to serve as a distraction). She died on the Thursday (only seven days after my 24th birthday), and I was in London for a few days before returning home to Cheshire on the Sunday. Less than an hour after getting back home, and not having much time to talk things through with my parents, I went out to church to practice some songs for the evening service. The music group that evening was made up of me, my mum and one other guy. We started the first song, which was '10,000 Reasons' by Matt Redman. The third verse is what got to me most of all:\n\n\"And on that day when my strength is failing,\n\nThe end draws near and my time has come.\n\nStill my soul will sing Your praise unending.\n\nTen thousand years and then forever more!\"\n\nI could just feel my voice going in that, but I still managed to hold myself together until we finished. Mum then made a comment about how the third verse reminded her of Gran and the events of the past few weeks, and I then just lost it and burst into tears. The other guy in the music group just put his arm around me, and I was so incredibly grateful for that. I then eventually managed to pull myself together and get through the rest of the music practice. Just before the service started, though, I ended up in tears again, but composed myself and managed to somehow get through the whole thing. I was thankful that the other guy was able to give a strong vocal lead, as I wasn't in terribly good shape to do that. Without any doubt, it was by far the toughest church service I have ever had to get myself through, and one of the hardest things I've ever had to do in my life. I was nearly in tears at a few points during my gran's funeral as well, but managed to get through that OK. I miss her so much. I honestly don't think a day's gone by since she died when I haven't thought about her in one way or another.",
