Strange advice to a 10 year old whose Dad worked a factory job and whose thought of school was endless summers.\n\nAnd so I read. No guidance or anything apart from \"don't read the dreck called Mills and Boon\".  Read whole bunches of stuff all alone and with a dictionary for words I didn't get.  All my friends did the same with varying degrees of interest.\n\nYou know that pic that Bill Gates once posted of children in India studying under street lights?  We were a richer version of that in that 'frog in the well' location crevice in the boonies of India.\n\nStill haven't read a single Mills and Boon book. not even out of curiosity to know why.",

Strange advice to a 10 year old whose Dad worked a factory job and whose thought of school was endless summers.</p>\n\n<p>And so I read. No guidance or anything apart from &quot;don&#39;t read the dreck called Mills and Boon&quot;.  Read whole bunches of stuff all alone and with a dictionary for words I didn&#39;t get.  All my friends did the same with varying degrees of interest.</p>\n\n<p>You know that pic that Bill Gates once posted of children in India studying under street lights?  We were a richer version of that in that &#39;frog in the well&#39; location crevice in the boonies of India.</p>\n\n<p>Still haven&#39;t read a single Mills and Boon book. not even out of curiosity to know why.</p>\n</div>",
