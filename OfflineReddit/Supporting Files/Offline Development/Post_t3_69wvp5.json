He&#39;s much more aggressive with his opinions and preferences, and Im much more easy going. For example, I really wanted to visit a wildlife sanctuary, when the day came we had that scheduled he said it was too hot and that we should move it to another day. I pointed out our other days were booked, and he just shrugged and said too bad. Im not into forcing people to do things they dont want to do- so I didnt throw a fit and insist. I know I should be more vocal and forceful, but I dont feel like a considerate person would do that. </p>\n</div>",

I know I am prone to motion sickness and always carry my go-to remedies when I travel (for me, peppermint Altoids, chewing gum, and Dramamine). If you know you get carsick and didn't do anything to mitigate that possibility, I can understand him having some frustration with that.\n\n- Issue Two - Does he know the depth of your water aversion? Did you explain this when the trip was planned. You say downthread he knows you don't swim in the apt. complex's pool and don't like to get your face wet in the shower, but to me, those things don't really indicate a fear of swimming. My husband doesn't like getting his face wet in the shower or swimming in pools, but he's an excellent swimmer who loves SCUBA diving, snorkelling, and open-water swimming. If you didn't make a point of how fearful you are, I could understand him thinking you'd be game and then being frustrated and embarrassed that you were so fearful and unskilled that you had to be helped out by the staff.\n\n- Issue 3 - Depending on the actual circumstances, I can see the frustration here as well. Was the shoe place near where you were walking, or did you have to go out of your way? Did you just mention you wanted shoes, or did you complain about how bad the old ones hurt for an extended period of time? Ultimately, I'd expect an adult to be able to pack an appropriate wardrobe for a trip like this and would be disappointed if my partner showed me that they couldn't live up to that expectation.\n\n- Issue 4 - This, again, depends a lot on how things actually went down. Were you quietly sick in the bathroom, and he was just disturbed by the occasional noises escaping? Or were you constantly walking back and forth between the bed and the bathroom, turning on lights, complaining about how you felt, etc. While some noises are natural and forgiveable, being ill doesn't really make it ok to do actively disruptive stuff all night long.\n\nNow, only you know what actually happened. Everyone else has great thoughts on things from your POV, and they might be right, he might be borderline abusive/manipulative, selfish, etc. But i can also see how this might be a simple incompatibility.\n\nAlso, even though you split the cost 50/50, I think it's important to remember it WAS his vacation, just like it was also yours. It's likely that both of you have limited funds and time off to spend on a vacation, so you should BOTH have had the best time possible.",
