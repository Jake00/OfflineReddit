            "body": "Not taking advantage of all the resources available to you in college is the biggest rookie move of all. My local community college is not a top tier 80k per-year institution by a long shot. It has a writing lab with English tutors, a math lab with math tutors, copies of every required book in the library so you don't have to buy a $300 book and counselors who can help you deal with stress better, plan your classes better, and properly structure your classes around meeting transfer requirements to specific 4-year universities. That's just to start. They've got dozens more programs and avenues for help than I'll ever need.\n\nFurthermore, a lot of people make the huge mistake of not coming to their professors and *talking to them*  when they have problems, have to miss tests, or just need clarification on the material. You'd be surprised how flexible a professor can be. I really wanted to make a 4.0 this semester, so I asked a professor if he could just give me two extra points on a test because that's all I needed. He didn't have a problem with it at all and gave me the two points. *Never* be afraid to ask for help. Some professors are douchebags, but most are really just trying to help you and want nothing more than for you to make a 100 in their class. (Rate My Professor is your best friend when trying to avoid douchebags.)\n\nI'd also like to add that you should really do some research on the career you're going to be getting into before you get a degree in it. Teaching and Nursing are hugely popular majors at my college, but both fields are incredibly oversaturated and taking only the cream, of the cream, of the cream of the crop. You need a 4.0 and a Harvard-flawless transcript just to get into the nursing program at the state university here. There are plenty of little-known degree fields that are a thousand percent less competitive and pay a lot better. (I am a Geology major and I love it!)",

Work problems are like the proverbial monkey on the back. An employee will come to the boss with a problem and instead of guiding the employee to solve the problem, the boss will just say I can handle that. So the employee then takes the monkey off his back and puts it on the boss. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The boss then runs into another employee with a different monkey an the same exchange happens. Now the boss as two monkeys on his back. If the boss is not careful he or she can end is his/her day with a pile of monkeys on this back and no time to address them. Don&#39;t solve the employees problems. Help the employees solve the problem.</p>\n</div>",
