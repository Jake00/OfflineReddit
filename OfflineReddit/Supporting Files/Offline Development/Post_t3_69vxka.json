His lawyer will talk about time spent in the marriage and how it will impact division of martial assets. She will have inheritance money; he is not entitled to it. However since she&#39;ll be more financially fluid he could have it where in case of divorce, he gets the house, etc. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s honestly between their lawyers to go over incoming debts, their careers, etc to bang it out. I had a friend who married with a prenup saying work she did for her husband&#39;s business would allow her to have claim to a stake in it since she was doing it for pretty much free/cheap when it ran into some trouble. He took over and decided he was going to leave her for his personal assistant. </p>\n\n<p>She gained rightful compensation for a lot of the accounting/HR work she did for his family company because of it.</p>\n</div>",

He wanted me to change my personality, my dreams, and essentially my goals because he was worried I was going to become \"a kept woman\". He began showing interest in my father's business and once tried to suggest going into business with my father. That was quickly shut down. In the end, he wanted me to be more like him (very driven, obsessed with achieving) and less like me. He thought the money would be able to create a massive income for \"us\" (a.k.a. Him) through investments and business creation. It didn't work.\n\nMy first husband, upon finding out about my family wealth, told me elaborate lies about his education and job prospects, claiming to be working towards a $250k a year, international engineering position. He got upset when I asked for a post nup after finding out about his lies (they were numerous, nearly impossible to find it about until I was given access to info after we married, etc) and he became extremely abusive. We divorced and he threatened to take me to jail over my inheritance... My father is still alive and well.\n\nMy current husband was not phased at all. He's poor, grew up poor, we live poor, and we're happy. He doesn't count on us getting anything upon my father's passing and he's always be a hard worker- but says that if I were to inherit some money it wouldn't change him and we would essentially put it away for an earlier retirement.\n\nSounds like this guy wants to be successful. He sees that your parents have been able to and he wants to be able to provide you with a similar lifestyle. Keep an eye out for red flags though (making plans for your money, making comments about it, or flat out asking you questions that make you uncomfortable - like if you're going to share it or not).
