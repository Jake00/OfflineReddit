They say a vacation is the best way to get to know someone! </p>\n\n<p>Problem one- I got extremely carsick. The place we visited had really wild driving, our driver had to pull over multiple times to let me throw up. My bf became annoyed with me. I finally asked if they could just drop me back at the hotel and he could do his own thing. He said no, it would waste too much time and said it was selfish for me to even suggest that.</p>\n\n<p>The second issue- Im scared of being underwater and cant swim well. He knows this. He wanted to book an adventure tour where you swim and jump off waterfalls. I said I didnt want to, but would be totally fine with him doing it. He complained and said sometimes we have to do things for people we love, so I gave in and thought I could tough through it. Didnt go well. I ended up shaking and crying during it at one point and had to be helped by staff multiple times because I couldn&#39;t swim well enough. He got really mad at this and said I made a scene and that I should have made it clearer I didn&#39;t want to.</p>\n\n<p>Third- We did quite a bit of walking one day and my shoes were rubbing my feet raw. I asked if we could stop and buy some shoes, and then we did- but he was extremely huffy about it and lectured me on how I should have worn better shoes. (they weren&#39;t heels or anything, they were flats, didnt realize they&#39;d be so uncomfortable).</p>\n\n<p>4- I got a stomach bug one night (common for travelers in that country) and my commotion in the bathroom kept him up. </p>\n\n<p>Afterwards he said he&#39;s never going on another trip with me and that I ruined his vacation.

          "selftext": "I'll try to be as objective as possible. They say a vacation is the best way to get to know someone! \n\nProblem one- I got extremely carsick. The place we visited had really wild driving, our driver had to pull over multiple times to let me throw up. My bf became annoyed with me. I finally asked if they could just drop me back at the hotel and he could do his own thing. He said no, it would waste too much time and said it was selfish for me to even suggest that.\n\nThe second issue- Im scared of being underwater and cant swim well. He knows this. He wanted to book an adventure tour where you swim and jump off waterfalls. I said I didnt want to, but would be totally fine with him doing it. He complained and said sometimes we have to do things for people we love, so I gave in and thought I could tough through it. Didnt go well. I ended up shaking and crying during it at one point and had to be helped by staff multiple times because I couldn't swim well enough. He got really mad at this and said I made a scene and that I should have made it clearer I didn't want to.\n\nThird- We did quite a bit of walking one day and my shoes were rubbing my feet raw. I asked if we could stop and buy some shoes, and then we did- but he was extremely huffy about it and lectured me on how I should have worn better shoes. (they weren't heels or anything, they were flats, didnt realize they'd be so uncomfortable).\n\n4- I got a stomach bug one night (common for travelers in that country) and my commotion in the bathroom kept him up. \n\nAfterwards he said he's never going on another trip with me and that I ruined his vacation. I do realize that I was difficult, but it wasn't by choice, and I gave him multiple ways out of it.  I also feel like we didnt do a single thing or activity that I really wanted to, and I honestly didnt even want to go to the country we went, and he knew that. In my mind, he treated it like it was *his* trip even though we split the cost 50/50. \n \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: My bf feels that I was selfish and needy and ruined his trip.

A good example would be that he one time saw me taking a nap during the day, and went into this existential crisis mode that I was severely depressing and lazy and he wouldn&#39;t stop nagging me to go outside and eventually started yelling that he didnt raise me right. I just wanted to fucking nap. Or sometimes if I would go out at night, he would start going into his yelling-crisis mode and complain that I go out too often even if I hadn&#39;t been out for weeks. Or one time I got in the car and he saw a stain on my shirt, and went on an hour long argument about how I have never been a clean person and I am just naturally dirty. He takes very anecdotal situations and turns them into entire personality traits, even if they dont apply at all, and its not only to me, my aunt and my mom have said he does this. Im not sure if its a psychological problem with him or what, but its obviously very demeaning and frustrating to deal with. </p>\n\n<p>So I have been away at college and my dad texted me in the morning saying he was gonna swing by my apartment later and say hi, I was like oh fuck, I dont really have time to clean. I was at class when he texted me. I told my roommates no ridiculous shit. </p>\n\n<p>He swung by my apartment around right when I got back, and right away he starts making comments. Then we get to the actual apartment, and my 2 roommates are there on the couch drinking beers, with chinese food laid out on the table, and the bong was also out. They quickly put it away, my dad didnt say anything he just said hi. All I could think was &quot;please dont fucking freak out, be mature and reasonable for once dad&quot; and he didnt then, he didnt freak out. </p>\n\n<p>Then when we left the apartment, right when we get outside he starts going off &quot;what what the hell was that? what was that? A bong? what the hell is going on, you smoke that? You drink those beers? You know what, thats fucked up, your fucked up&quot; and it just went on and on. I just sighed, I knew he was gonna go into his crazy judgmental manic moods. He tries to pass it off like he just &#39;cares too much&#39; but there is no way this is caring, this is more like condescending. In the end, it was almost like he was talking to himself, he must have said &quot;you know what! actually...&quot; like 20 times and then said a more ridiculous statement following the last. I just didnt even want to say anything, I just sighed and shook my head, and that got him even more kind of manic and upset. Its like he convinces himself that things are worse than they are. </p>\n\n<p>So I just left him, I just told him right there &quot;look dad, I am not gonna stay here for you to berate me, go home and talk to mom and she will calm you down&quot; and I just walked the other direction. I honestly felt like I wanted to cry, I hadnt seen him except briefly for 7 months, and he barely had anything to say except that. He didnt notice my new apartment, he didnt say anything about my new job at the office, or my 3.8 GPA, or anything. He must have said &quot;your life is going to shit, its gonna go to shit&quot; like 10 times.</p>\n\n<p>He called me later and said &quot;look, look im sorry, I really am, but i cant continue to support you at all if your gonna live that fucking lifestyle, with the what, the potsmoking? Come on who does that? What the hell is that? Get a fucking life! go the fuck outside (not even sure where this came from)&quot; and he proceeded to rant for five minutes and then to tell me he not going to help me pay for college anymore. I just got mad honestly, I was like nobody can be this fucking unreasonable. He didnt even give a way for me to really &#39;change&#39; my lifestyle. I said it was my roommates who smoke (which isnt true, i do too, but w/e) and he said &quot;well i dont fucking know, kick them out then!!&quot; and he then started ranting to himself that kids like me always end up in rehab, we are the worst. It was bad, its just hurtful to hear and deal with constantly. He ended it saying maybe I should move back, and I can commute to work and school. He lives an hour away, I live currently 15 min away... so no. </p>\n\n<p>We just got into a huge, huge fight over this. I understand its great that he is helping me out in the first place (well no, its my mom, she earns 2x more than him) but what he said combined with what he is threatening to do? Nah, he came in there LOOKING to make excuses to hate and insult me, like i am some punching bag. I probably shouldnt have gotten upset, but like, what the fuck was that? I told him it wasn&#39;t my pot, it was just roommates, but he didnt even let me speak at all. </p>\n\n<p>What do I do? I cannot afford college. Not even close, its a 45k a year college. I tried calling and texting my mom, no response, its been days. Im not sure what is going on. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: dad wants to cut me off because he came into my apartment and saw pot and beers. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I don&#39;t typically complain to my boyfriend. But in this case, I felt I deserved to unload a little. He listened for all of ten seconds, interrupted me mid-sentence and immediately started siding with my boss saying it&#39;s her responsibility to make sure the office runs smoothly and efficiently, and sometimes, it&#39;s necessary to shout to get the job done. I understood where he was coming from, but that wasn&#39;t the point. I wasn&#39;t arguing the reason that she had shouted, I was simply unloading my frustration over being humiliated and blamed for something that was not my fault whatsoever.

If I had the habit of asking him to finish my food for me when we eat out and never being satisfied with the food that I order, then I&#39;d absolutely get why he would react this way and try to talk me out of that dish.

Again, he was doing the most and dissecting every minor detail, seemingly just for the sake of doing so. </p>\n\n<p>Later, when we were driving back to my place, we got on the topic of ballet. I&#39;m a paralegal and a ballet instructor. I was saying something about one of the girls in my class (age 15) and how she had suggested that our studio open up a ballet-focused YouTube channel where we can post dance covers and what not. I was telling him how I think it&#39;s a great idea and how the girls and I are going to try and convince the owner of the studio to let us do it. He could tell that I was very excited about this, happy to help the girls and work on a new project. He immediately said that he thought the idea was &quot;sketchy&quot; because they&#39;re young. I explained that the &quot;sketchy&quot; aspect exists in the world anyway, and although it hurts me that some very disturbed individuals feel the need to sexualize everyone and everything they see, their sick minds should NEVER stop anyone from doing what they love. He then went on to say that he respects my opinion, but that I don&#39;t know disgusting some people can be and how the comments in the videos will more than likely be a shock for me and for the girls and for their parents. I understand that. But you can moderate comments on YouTube channels. And we&#39;d obviously make sure we have parents&#39; permission before we post anything. I doubt any of them would object. On top of that, this was just an idea that was brought to my attention, something that I thought would be fun, a good opportunity for the girls to get creative and maybe gain some early recognition, and again, he just had to shut it down immediately. &quot;Best case scenario, you don&#39;t gain any recognition and your channel drowns alongside the hundreds of dance cover channels. Worst case scenario, it gets exploitative and you lose your integrity.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>I fully understand where he&#39;s coming from when he gets like this and I appreciate his concern. At the same, I find it all so unbelievably infuriating. </p>\n\n<p>That was one evening with him.</p>\n\n<p>A total of three hours. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve expressed to him countless times that I think he&#39;s a little too analytical sometimes, and sometimes it&#39;s nice to just <em>talk</em> without exhausting every possible angle of the topic. When all is said and done, he does apologize. Not every time, but usually. I admire him for challenging me at times. It keeps things fresh. But everyday? All the time?

So I only got a couple of responses to my original post, but <a href=\"/u/EvilNotBadPotato\">u/EvilNotBadPotato</a> requested an update, so I thought I&#39;d give one.</p>\n\n<p>The therapist I ended up getting to talk to has been fantastic. She gave me kudos for recognizing there was no legitimate reason to be worried about what may happen, even though I&#39;ve been out of a therapy for a while. She gave me a few things to think about to help ease my mind and get me back on track. She asked if I truly trusted him, as in if a planned phone call didn&#39;t happen would my first thought be &quot;Something came up&quot; or would it be &quot;He&#39;s doing something he shouldn&#39;t be doing.&quot; Since we talk 90% of the time as soon as he leaves work, this is something I have experience with. The 10% of the time we don&#39;t talk, I have never wondered if he was doing something shady. I always think something came up - either he got stuck at work, decided to call family instead - whatever. I don&#39;t really rack my brain to figure it out, and usually he&#39;ll tell me when we do talk. </p>\n\n<p>Then she asked what facts about the trip were triggering my jealousy. It was very clearly the friends younger sister staying at his house the night before the trip and riding down with him, then being there when I knew they were going to be partying. Then I felt really, really stupid when she reminded me there will be girls all over the place when he&#39;s out drinking, and every time he&#39;s gone out before I haven&#39;t had an issue. It didn&#39;t make any sense I wasn&#39;t feeling insecure with these unknown girls, only one who I <em>knew</em> was pretty. When it came down to it, I was thinking about what-could-be&#39;s and creating this imaginary scenario that got me concerned. I&#39;m was only thinking about her being a younger, prettier girl without knowing anything else about her. That wasn&#39;t just unfair to him, that was unfair to both me and the girl as well.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe this all came from residual insecurities from being cheated on by someone who put a ring on my finger. Maybe it stemmed from  hidden residual emotions from being in a controlling relationship where I was essentially told what&#39;s &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; in a relationship, and that included not being with people of the opposite sex without the SO. Either way, I know it was the wrong response to have. We did talk about that a bit, about why the controlling behaviors were wrong and how it affected me and the relationship in general. It kind of sucked to realize that if I had not recognized that and had gone off the deepend I would be no better than my ex was. That was an eye-opener. </p>\n\n<p>She had me spend a lot of time basically meditating about positive aspects of our life and our relationship, as well as the ways I had seen myself improve over the last two years. She reminded me to trust both his words and his actions over the last year, and to even repeat &quot;I don&#39;t have to worry about that, because I trust him&quot; mentally when I would think about it and start to worry. </p>\n\n<p>BUT I only had to do that for about two days. Because two days after I wrote that post, my SO ended up in the ER. It wasn&#39;t anything serious, but when he texted to tell me where he was going and to call his parents, I was there immediately. I took him home, made sure I had all the info from the attending, cooked him the doctor-ordered soft food meals for the next few days, etc. </p>\n\n<p>In a group text with his family, he mentioned that I was being amazing to him, and he was lucky to have me there. His family all responded with similar messages. I teared up reading a lot of what was said. He spent a lot (a LOT) of time after that telling me about how much he appreciates all the things I do for him all the time and how he&#39;s never had someone take care of him like that. He also, out of the blue, mentioned &quot;just like I&#39;ve never had somebody trust me like you do.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Pete left Thursday AM with only one of his guy friends, since the others had some issues come up (sick kids and not meeting sales quotas) and the other friend&#39;s younger sister. They went out a couple of nights, with the younger sister as well, and came home today. I never asked for it, but he took so much time calling and texting me updates about his day, I really had no time to worry. </p>\n\n<p>I kind of feel like the luckiest girl on Earth to have such an awesome guy, and to know he thinks I&#39;m pretty damn awesome to. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Contacted a therapist who helped me realize where my insecurities may have been coming from.

          "selftext": "**Link to Original Post: [Original] https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/67ll1k/help_not_let_my_29f_insecurities_affect/**\n  \nHi guys! So I only got a couple of responses to my original post, but u/EvilNotBadPotato requested an update, so I thought I'd give one.\n\nThe therapist I ended up getting to talk to has been fantastic. She gave me kudos for recognizing there was no legitimate reason to be worried about what may happen, even though I've been out of a therapy for a while. She gave me a few things to think about to help ease my mind and get me back on track. She asked if I truly trusted him, as in if a planned phone call didn't happen would my first thought be \"Something came up\" or would it be \"He's doing something he shouldn't be doing.\" Since we talk 90% of the time as soon as he leaves work, this is something I have experience with. The 10% of the time we don't talk, I have never wondered if he was doing something shady. I always think something came up - either he got stuck at work, decided to call family instead - whatever. I don't really rack my brain to figure it out, and usually he'll tell me when we do talk. \n\nThen she asked what facts about the trip were triggering my jealousy. It was very clearly the friends younger sister staying at his house the night before the trip and riding down with him, then being there when I knew they were going to be partying. Then I felt really, really stupid when she reminded me there will be girls all over the place when he's out drinking, and every time he's gone out before I haven't had an issue. It didn't make any sense I wasn't feeling insecure with these unknown girls, only one who I *knew* was pretty. When it came down to it, I was thinking about what-could-be's and creating this imaginary scenario that got me concerned. I'm was only thinking about her being a younger, prettier girl without knowing anything else about her. That wasn't just unfair to him, that was unfair to both me and the girl as well.\n\nMaybe this all came from residual insecurities from being cheated on by someone who put a ring on my finger. Maybe it stemmed from  hidden residual emotions from being in a controlling relationship where I was essentially told what's \"right\" and \"wrong\" in a relationship, and that included not being with people of the opposite sex without the SO. Either way, I know it was the wrong response to have. We did talk about that a bit, about why the controlling behaviors were wrong and how it affected me and the relationship in general. It kind of sucked to realize that if I had not recognized that and had gone off the deepend I would be no better than my ex was. That was an eye-opener. \n\nShe had me spend a lot of time basically meditating about positive aspects of our life and our relationship, as well as the ways I had seen myself improve over the last two years. She reminded me to trust both his words and his actions over the last year, and to even repeat \"I don't have to worry about that, because I trust him\" mentally when I would think about it and start to worry. \n\nBUT I only had to do that for about two days. Because two days after I wrote that post, my SO ended up in the ER. It wasn't anything serious, but when he texted to tell me where he was going and to call his parents, I was there immediately. I took him home, made sure I had all the info from the attending, cooked him the doctor-ordered soft food meals for the next few days, etc. \n\nIn a group text with his family, he mentioned that I was being amazing to him, and he was lucky to have me there. His family all responded with similar messages. I teared up reading a lot of what was said. He spent a lot (a LOT) of time after that telling me about how much he appreciates all the things I do for him all the time and how he's never had someone take care of him like that. He also, out of the blue, mentioned \"just like I've never had somebody trust me like you do.\" \n\nPete left Thursday AM with only one of his guy friends, since the others had some issues come up (sick kids and not meeting sales quotas) and the other friend's younger sister. They went out a couple of nights, with the younger sister as well, and came home today. I never asked for it, but he took so much time calling and texting me updates about his day, I really had no time to worry. \n\nI kind of feel like the luckiest girl on Earth to have such an awesome guy, and to know he thinks I'm pretty damn awesome to. \n\n\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Contacted a therapist who helped me realize where my insecurities may have been coming from. She gave me meditation exercises, had me focus on the positive things in the relationship, as well as the positive things in myself. \n\nPete had an small health scare, and let me take care of him for a few days while he healed. He showed me in so many ways how much he appreciates me in his life (he has done this many times before, as well, this was just relevant with the timing of it all). \n\nI'm a lucky chick who luckily didn't go crazy.

He had a drug history I was unaware of, until he moved in about six months into the relationship. I had suspicions but couldn&#39;t prove anything as I was not an addict, nor had I ever used. Fast forward two months and he stole my car and all my money while I was in the shower. He overdosed on heroin and totaled my car, wrecked into a concrete wall. Underwent many brain surgeries and about 3 months in ICU and rehabilitation. That being said, he has a traumatic brain injury. Anger issues are an extremely common side effect, but until recently, never been an issue. A lot of details and hard decisions went into me deciding to give him a second chance. He took full responsibility and is doing everything to make it up to me. </p>\n\n<p>Initially, he moved back in with me. He is now mostly blind with other minor disabilities, he got comfortable on his own and decided to move to a sober living facility, which he now manages. He&#39;s been there a year and has 18 months clean so he has decided to move back in with me next week. </p>\n\n<p>Well.. I&#39;ve had issues with him staying in contact with his last girlfriend who he was drug-buddies with. They were still &quot;talking&quot; the day he wrecked my car. He assured me he would never speak to her again. I&#39;ve seen many of her comments on his social media and he was too friendly for my liking. I took it upon myself (wrong, I know) to look through his phone when he left the room. Sure enough, they&#39;d been talking on the weekly. Nothing intimate or sexual, just too comfortable for my personal borders in a relationship. Plus, he said he hadn&#39;t talked to her in over a year. I got upset and asked why he had lied. He lost his shit immediately. He grabbed my head and shook it really hard, screaming &quot;call this abuse if you want but I&#39;m done with you!&quot; </p>\n\n<p>So I waited a while, got off the bed and approached him in the bathroom where he was smoking a cigarette. I said to him that what he just did was not acceptable and he should apologize or leave. He began yelling again and when he stood up, he grabbed my shoulders and threw me into the bathtub. I think I blacked out because next thing I knew I was sitting on the floor outside the tub and my roommate, who heard the noise, came to see if I was okay. I was kind of in shock and didn&#39;t feel any pain but I was just so confused. I told her what happened and cried heavily, followed by a panic attack. (I&#39;ve had maybe 4-5 as an adult) she calmed me down and I went back to my room where he was seemingly asleep in bed. I laid down and again cried quietly when he rolled over and seemed entirely confused by what happened. He apologized and comforted me until I fell asleep.</p>\n\n<p>I woke up the next day in major pain. It&#39;s been a week and I&#39;ve till got a headache and nausea, there is a bruise from my upper arm to my shoulder blade, and an extremely black bruise that takes up the entire side of my left thigh, probably 4x10 inches that has developed a painful rash as well. </p>\n\n<p>He told me he went to a psychiatrist and has talked to his sponsor and regrets what he did and doesn&#39;t know what came over him. He blocked the girl and has been ok since. But he doesn&#39;t seem remorseful. He avoids the topic and when I send him pictures of my injuries or complain about the pain (I&#39;ve was sent home the day after for limping at work) he says &quot;sorry you aren&#39;t feeling well!&quot; But not even in a sarcastic way. It&#39;s like he doesn&#39;t even believe he did that to me. I don&#39;t know what to do. He has never gotten even somewhat aggressive towards me much less straight out abusive. Is there such a thing as being hit only once? Is there someone I should talk to besides police? If I said anything to friends or family it&#39;s like they would just dismiss the scenario and say &quot;fuck it leave!!&quot; But we&#39;ve already been through much worse and grown because of it. Is this just a symptom of a TBI that he is taking care of by seeing a doctor? I need help and advice and support and I don&#39;t know where to go. Please help me think clearly, I need it so much right now. Thank you for reading and/or replying. xoxo</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR my super gentle bf doesn&#39;t remember he threw me in a tub.

Is this just a symptom of a TBI that he is taking care of by seeing a doctor? I need help and advice and support and I don't know where to go. Please help me think clearly, I need it so much right now. Thank you for reading and/or replying. xoxo\n\n\n**TL;DR my super gentle bf doesn't remember he threw me in a tub. Stay or not?** \n",
