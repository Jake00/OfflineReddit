A good example would be that he one time saw me taking a nap during the day, and went into this existential crisis mode that I was severely depressing and lazy and he wouldn&#39;t stop nagging me to go outside and eventually started yelling that he didnt raise me right. I just wanted to fucking nap. Or sometimes if I would go out at night, he would start going into his yelling-crisis mode and complain that I go out too often even if I hadn&#39;t been out for weeks. Or one time I got in the car and he saw a stain on my shirt, and went on an hour long argument about how I have never been a clean person and I am just naturally dirty. He takes very anecdotal situations and turns them into entire personality traits, even if they dont apply at all, and its not only to me, my aunt and my mom have said he does this. Im not sure if its a psychological problem with him or what, but its obviously very demeaning and frustrating to deal with. </p>\n\n<p>So I have been away at college and my dad texted me in the morning saying he was gonna swing by my apartment later and say hi, I was like oh fuck, I dont really have time to clean. I was at class when he texted me. I told my roommates no ridiculous shit. </p>\n\n<p>He swung by my apartment around right when I got back, and right away he starts making comments. Then we get to the actual apartment, and my 2 roommates are there on the couch drinking beers, with chinese food laid out on the table, and the bong was also out. They quickly put it away, my dad didnt say anything he just said hi. All I could think was &quot;please dont fucking freak out, be mature and reasonable for once dad&quot; and he didnt then, he didnt freak out. </p>\n\n<p>Then when we left the apartment, right when we get outside he starts going off &quot;what what the hell was that? what was that? A bong? what the hell is going on, you smoke that? You drink those beers? You know what, thats fucked up, your fucked up&quot; and it just went on and on. I just sighed, I knew he was gonna go into his crazy judgmental manic moods. He tries to pass it off like he just &#39;cares too much&#39; but there is no way this is caring, this is more like condescending. In the end, it was almost like he was talking to himself, he must have said &quot;you know what! actually...&quot; like 20 times and then said a more ridiculous statement following the last. I just didnt even want to say anything, I just sighed and shook my head, and that got him even more kind of manic and upset. Its like he convinces himself that things are worse than they are. </p>\n\n<p>So I just left him, I just told him right there &quot;look dad, I am not gonna stay here for you to berate me, go home and talk to mom and she will calm you down&quot; and I just walked the other direction. I honestly felt like I wanted to cry, I hadnt seen him except briefly for 7 months, and he barely had anything to say except that. He didnt notice my new apartment, he didnt say anything about my new job at the office, or my 3.8 GPA, or anything. He must have said &quot;your life is going to shit, its gonna go to shit&quot; like 10 times.</p>\n\n<p>He called me later and said &quot;look, look im sorry, I really am, but i cant continue to support you at all if your gonna live that fucking lifestyle, with the what, the potsmoking? Come on who does that? What the hell is that? Get a fucking life! go the fuck outside (not even sure where this came from)&quot; and he proceeded to rant for five minutes and then to tell me he not going to help me pay for college anymore. I just got mad honestly, I was like nobody can be this fucking unreasonable. He didnt even give a way for me to really &#39;change&#39; my lifestyle. I said it was my roommates who smoke (which isnt true, i do too, but w/e) and he said &quot;well i dont fucking know, kick them out then!!&quot; and he then started ranting to himself that kids like me always end up in rehab, we are the worst. It was bad, its just hurtful to hear and deal with constantly. He ended it saying maybe I should move back, and I can commute to work and school. He lives an hour away, I live currently 15 min away... so no. </p>\n\n<p>We just got into a huge, huge fight over this. I understand its great that he is helping me out in the first place (well no, its my mom, she earns 2x more than him) but what he said combined with what he is threatening to do? Nah, he came in there LOOKING to make excuses to hate and insult me, like i am some punching bag. I probably shouldnt have gotten upset, but like, what the fuck was that? I told him it wasn&#39;t my pot, it was just roommates, but he didnt even let me speak at all. </p>\n\n<p>What do I do? I cannot afford college. Not even close, its a 45k a year college. I tried calling and texting my mom, no response, its been days. Im not sure what is going on. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: dad wants to cut me off because he came into my apartment and saw pot and beers. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

And when you get away and reject those funds, somehow they aren't like, \"Well, now that they don't take my money, they don't have to follow my rules.\"\n\n**It's a lot more like, \"How dare that fucking piece of shit refuse to take my money.\"**\n\nWhen someone loooooves using their money to make you do what they want, and loooooves using it to harm you, that ain't, \"Their money, their rules,\" anymore. That's just evil.\n\nHow many millions should someone have to pay, to earn the right to psychologically pummel someone? I don't think there's actually any amount that's enough.

Here it is $10K for tuition per year and +/- $10K living expenses per year and it cuts so deep into our household budget with one kid in school, like super duper fucking deep. I can not even fathom figuring out 45K per year so I would be so upset if randomly I saw my kids roommates drinking/bonging and yes I would assume my kid also did that.  I would be so disappointed that my kid wasn't taking our sacrifice seriously to put pedal to the metal and focus (because if you have time to watch tv and smoke up - maybe you could use that to study and get a 4.0!)  But I'd be even more upset, livid even, if I knew my kid thought of me with so much disrespect to belittle my contribution because the other parent earned more then I did. That's really fucking shitty of you and you need to grow up. Yes, Dad freaking out isn't fun to deal with and it's a personality flaw of his, but it's just so awful of you to feel that his opinion means nothing or he has NO say because he earns less. Dad does pay for it if he's married to someone who is also earning a paycheque because both in that partnership have to go without to pay your bills and both your parents are making a huge sacrifice to keep your tuition paid so I would try to have a smidgen of respect or stop taking their help at all if that's how you really feel about him. It's just so dirty. I'm really disappointed in the level of entitlement you have - that's a massive personality flaw that you need to figure out for yourself. And for all you know - maybe your tuition IS too much for them to take on and maybe they DO need a way out of it.  You've gotten a lot of help, so you can take out loans to cover yourself if your parents can not or choose not to help you any more.\n  \nFor now -  just take a deep breath and with a clear head call your mom or write an email and explain that Dad showed up, saw roommates bong, and was understandably shocked and upset.  You don't smoke up (and if you do, stop) and you don't drink during the week (and if you do, stop) and you need her help in calming Dad down.  Living by yourself doesn't make sense financially, and commuting doesn't make sense for your study habits but you will keep to yourself and maintain your GPA and you apologize that Dad was upset with the choices your roommates make.  You appreciate and can not manage without their help, if they'd feel more comfortable with a contract or agreement in place so they can be confident you're making the best choices that you're more then willing to abide to it.  And then start looking for a better job or figure out scholarships so you can pitch in as much as you can and ready yourself for independence.",

However, you haven't got reasonable parents; you're on a tight leash, and you don't want to lose university funding.

Work together on some solutions to his concerns, and in doing so, get your dad to explore how quickly he jumped to the wrong conclusions or focused on one thing and dismissed everything else. Look at cost and benefit of these solutions in a meticulous way, which might show him how his initial idea of \"moving out\" was cost-ineffective. Have a heart to heart, because maybe your dad is lashing out due to some deep-seated insecurities, about himself, about you, and keep reminding him with evidence-based examples of why you are responsible. Lie about the potsmoking. After you have settled on a mutually agreed solution, and he has calmed down, talk about how hurt you were by his initial response, and ask him if things could have been done differently next time. That's how I did it with my mom, and although she turned me into her therapist which killed me, it did stop her from being so angry because I exhausted HER with all my emotional and logical exploration.

Perhaps he needs to hear them - I don't know if you'd feel comfortable doing this or not, given his outbursts. But at a safer time it might worth sitting him down and calmly pointing out how it makes you feel when he acts like this. He may already be aware of his tendency to overreact and feel unable to control it, but having it pointed out to him might encourage him to get some help, and improve his relationships.

I&#39;d be seriously upset too, but for now prioritise your own life and happiness, and get this situation resolved. Once this drama&#39;s over, it might be time for a come to Jesus talk with your dad. </p>\n\n<p>Your first paragraphs spelled out the problem with him succinctly and without judgement. Perhaps he needs to hear them - I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d feel comfortable doing this or not, given his outbursts. But at a safer time it might worth sitting him down and calmly pointing out how it makes you feel when he acts like this. He may already be aware of his tendency to overreact and feel unable to control it, but having it pointed out to him might encourage him to get some help, and improve his relationships. (NB it&#39;s DEFINITELY not your job to sort out his mental health, but I&#39;d personally feel so frustrated at being treated like this, I&#39;d want to try and resolve it.)</p>\n</div>",

There are many things that you will wish your father would help you with, but anything you accept from him will, with 100% certainty, come with strings attached. So if you can avoid that in any way, don't take it.\n\nFor now, you'll have to either accept your father's abuse, which sucks and hurts but will give you a chance to finish your degree and have a better starting chance. Talk to your mum. Cut your dad out. But be aware that she will, at some point, pressure you into talking to him again. \nOr, you will have to go to financial services, get an idea of how you could arrange to still finish uni and pay for the rest yourself.

Did you even bother to ask about my 3.8 GPA? Did you even take the time to ask about my new job that I just got? The one that I show up on time to everyday, the one that I work hard at while still maintaining good grades? \n\nI know I'm not the cleanest person, but honestly, it's none of your business. I get things done, and I'm doin well for myself. I'm my own man and how I choose to live is my choice. I wasn't born indebted to you and I don't need to live the way you want me to live. I know you help me with school, and i am very grateful for that, but you need to learn how to let me live my life. Sure, you could stop paying for my tuition, but then I'll become exactly what you expect out of me, nothing. You've always treated me like I'm lesser than you because of the way I live, but I am who I am. Stop trying to change me.

Do I look like a Fucking addict? You wanna know the lifestyle you support? Maybe you should actually take a good hard look into my life. </p>\n\n<p>You came over looking to pick a fight and find any reason to dislike me and what I&#39;m doing with my life. Did you even bother to ask about my 3.8 GPA? Did you even take the time to ask about my new job that I just got? The one that I show up on time to everyday, the one that I work hard at while still maintaining good grades? </p>\n\n<p>I know I&#39;m not the cleanest person, but honestly, it&#39;s none of your business. I get things done, and I&#39;m doin well for myself. I&#39;m my own man and how I choose to live is my choice. I wasn&#39;t born indebted to you and I don&#39;t need to live the way you want me to live. I know you help me with school, and i am very grateful for that, but you need to learn how to let me live my life. Sure, you could stop paying for my tuition, but then I&#39;ll become exactly what you expect out of me, nothing. You&#39;ve always treated me like I&#39;m lesser than you because of the way I live, but I am who I am. Stop trying to change me. Either you love and care for me for who I am or don&#39;t even bother.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>(This parts optional)</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sure you can stop helping me, but I&#39;ll do everything I can to make it. I&#39;ll prove you wrong and I will make it, just because you think I won&#39;t.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously saying this would be easier said that done, but hopefully his gives you something to work with if you choose to stand up to him. </p>\n\n<p>Hope it works out for you buddy. </p>\n</div>",
