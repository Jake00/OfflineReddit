Sleep is rough at times but I take sleep/tiredness very seriously and won't drive if I'm not fully rested. All drivers get paid differently, a company driver will make 30-50 cents a mile, and if you own your truck like me you get paid per load lets say $6100 for a load going from home(Rochester NY) to Los Angeles(2450 miles) but pay for fuel/scale tickets/IFTA tax. Some local drivers get hourly $16/$33 an hour. Round trip from home to home for me is usually about 6,000 miles and I do it in about 8/9 days. My truck isn't governed so o can do 80 in an 80mph zone. And that 6000 miles is roughly 85/90 hours of driving. Your very welcome for the story and appreciate the good gestures.",

I had to cook my brakes to the point they were almost on fire and stopping ability severely impared. Then a bike got in between me and said car. I thought I was going to kill the fellow. I was blasting air horn to get out of way, but he didn't understand he was a gnat flying down a shotgun barrel. I almost completely lost brakes right before traffic came to complete stop still on said 7% grade. I had to get out with fire extinguisher in hand, crawl under my truck and make sure there was no flames coming from my half melted liquid brakes, as my steer tires(very front) were throwing up huge clounds of smoke. All infront of a cop that had the right lane closed and 2 lanes was merging into one. I couldn't see this ahead of time as it was around a bend and was blind to it until it was too late. If I wasn't cut off there would be no issue. If there was a runaway ramp I would have taken it, as I almost killed a biker. But there wasn't one.\n\nEdit* don't ever get in front of my fucking truck, even on flat ground until you can see road in between the truck and you through your rearview. As even on flat ground we need over 200 more feet to stop at 55mph when fully loaded. Now add a 7% grade and you get my drift. All that extra room in front of me I put there, and is not for you.",

The tires sink deep into it.  I've been told by other drivers that it's actually quite a sudden and forceful stop.  From the trucks that I have seen stuck halfway down them, it did appear to be true.  Consider that a truck that has to take the ramp would have suffered brake failure and was likely moving at tremendous speed.  In 25 years of trucking, I have only heard of one case of a truck going past the end of one of those ramps.",

Sometimes a fine gravel.  The tires sink deep into it.  I&#39;ve been told by other drivers that it&#39;s actually quite a sudden and forceful stop.  From the trucks that I have seen stuck halfway down them, it did appear to be true.  Consider that a truck that has to take the ramp would have suffered brake failure and was likely moving at tremendous speed.  In 25 years of trucking, I have only heard of one case of a truck going past the end of one of those ramps.</p>\n</div>",

I was in a 1990 Nissan Maxima, and had been driving for about 8 hours (Buddy and I on a road trip) and was starting to get tired.

I eventually came to a stop, and had to rock my car out and back out the exact way I made it in. Twas frightening to say the least, 10/10 would not recommend.   ",
