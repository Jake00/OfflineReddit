I don&#39;t typically complain to my boyfriend. But in this case, I felt I deserved to unload a little. He listened for all of ten seconds, interrupted me mid-sentence and immediately started siding with my boss saying it&#39;s her responsibility to make sure the office runs smoothly and efficiently, and sometimes, it&#39;s necessary to shout to get the job done. I understood where he was coming from, but that wasn&#39;t the point. I wasn&#39;t arguing the reason that she had shouted, I was simply unloading my frustration over being humiliated and blamed for something that was not my fault whatsoever.

If I had the habit of asking him to finish my food for me when we eat out and never being satisfied with the food that I order, then I&#39;d absolutely get why he would react this way and try to talk me out of that dish.

Again, he was doing the most and dissecting every minor detail, seemingly just for the sake of doing so. </p>\n\n<p>Later, when we were driving back to my place, we got on the topic of ballet. I&#39;m a paralegal and a ballet instructor. I was saying something about one of the girls in my class (age 15) and how she had suggested that our studio open up a ballet-focused YouTube channel where we can post dance covers and what not. I was telling him how I think it&#39;s a great idea and how the girls and I are going to try and convince the owner of the studio to let us do it. He could tell that I was very excited about this, happy to help the girls and work on a new project. He immediately said that he thought the idea was &quot;sketchy&quot; because they&#39;re young. I explained that the &quot;sketchy&quot; aspect exists in the world anyway, and although it hurts me that some very disturbed individuals feel the need to sexualize everyone and everything they see, their sick minds should NEVER stop anyone from doing what they love. He then went on to say that he respects my opinion, but that I don&#39;t know disgusting some people can be and how the comments in the videos will more than likely be a shock for me and for the girls and for their parents. I understand that. But you can moderate comments on YouTube channels. And we&#39;d obviously make sure we have parents&#39; permission before we post anything. I doubt any of them would object. On top of that, this was just an idea that was brought to my attention, something that I thought would be fun, a good opportunity for the girls to get creative and maybe gain some early recognition, and again, he just had to shut it down immediately. &quot;Best case scenario, you don&#39;t gain any recognition and your channel drowns alongside the hundreds of dance cover channels. Worst case scenario, it gets exploitative and you lose your integrity.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>I fully understand where he&#39;s coming from when he gets like this and I appreciate his concern.

He's gonna have to make some serious decisions about his own behaviors before anything is really going to change and it doesn't sound like he's there yet. \n\nI really liked my logical husband but a lot of people td ne that he is an asshole. It didn't get to me much because I'm super stubborn and bossy and didn't care if I was proven wrong, I'd admit to being wrong and still be mad as hell. \n\nI kind of gave up on debating things with him and learned to limit vocalizing my wandering thoughts for a long time because I just didn't want to hear \"devil's advocate\" on ever passing thought I mentioned just to make conversation. \n\nIt really took some yelling back and forth, every time he started picking at my faults, reminding him that he had plenty of his own for him to start recognizing his behavior and learning to curb those impulses. He still does it, but not nearly as much and he's finally making some engineering friends that he can be all analytical with. But the big difference between you bf and my husband. My husband really made a conscious effort to take advantage of the times I engaged him to be analytical with me and really examine some idea together and talk it out and discuss different aspects of things I was interested in, not just every passing thing I said. He put real work into it. And I put work into thinking of things that we could talk about together like that. Like we made car games of thinking up hypothetical situations or designs and verbally working them out. It allowed him to examine a thought and allowed me to not get every single think I brought up +fixed+. \n\nIt took a long time, working with each other and I still have to specify to him sometimes when I'm just venting vs actively looking for a solution and he still finds it frustrating when I vent without wanting a solution. But he does put effort into it. And I had to really spell it out fir him once long ago that sometimes when women get with their friends, they need to talk about something that's bothering them and just say their problems out loud to a listener without actively trying to work out a solution. He still thinks that's the stupidest thing ever but he lets me do it and I key him talk about his technical stuff and answer him when he wants my opinion about something I absolutely do not care about. \n\nAll of that to say, you really need to spell it out fir your man in a very literal way and if he gives you lip service without really changing, then he has no actual interest in being in an equally respectful relationship and truly does not see you as his equal. And you have to decide how you feel about that and if you are okay with that for your life. Someone who really wants to be with YOU and not just a person who will put up with them will listen to what you have to say and actively make the behavioral changes you discuss with him that make you feel so bad. But you do have to give him a fair chance by being honest about it. \n\nIf you want to talk about it more because your bf really does sound a lot like my so, feel free to msg me and we can get more in depth.

He's the same way and has never changed. And I have always had a bossy personality. Ever since I was a small child. As I grew and began to challenge my dad, he behaved this way to me. And I returned it. And would never back down because he was so frustrating and irritating. I just wanted to win. He wouldn't listen to me. He just pushed my buttons over and over to antagonize me. But as a kid i didn't realize that. It sort of taught me that being wrong would be shameful because I would have to back down. And if i ever backed down against my dad he wouldn't let it go. He wasn't a gracious \"winner.\"\n\nI began feeling like I couldn't apologize. I had to be right. I felt like apologizing meant I was weak. Combined with being a teenager and then young adult who felt I was old enough to understand the world, I had to be right. \n\nBut I would eventually find myself in postions entirely proven wrong, I would know I was entirely wrong. And I wouldn't back down. Because that would be shameful and embarrassing. \n\nSurprisingly, I was super pleasant to be around. /s\n\nIt persisted into my early 20s. And with one particular boyfriend, who was just like my dad, we would have blowout fights over things that were tiny. Because we both had to be right.\n\nUnsurprisingly, I found myself sometime later single (he cheated and was otherwise abusive and awful) and I had driven away so many of my friends. It kind of dawned on me one day, I could insist on being \"right\" or I could have positive relationships. But not both. And I was tired of being lonely. Combative. Miserable. And argumentative. \n\nSo I got my ass off my high horse and apologized to my friends I had driven off while dating my jerk ex. I knew I may not be able to salvage all my friendships. And I was right, I had permanently ruined some. And that's on me. No matter my upbringing and how I became like that, at some point it was still my responsibility because I chose my own actions and responses. And I realized I had control over those. And being wrong and apologizing for it and admitting it was better than driving everyone away.\n\nSo I began to work at picking my battles. Small things weren't worth fighting over. And debates were possible without turning into fights if I could be respectful of alternative viewpoints. And I realized I could LEARN from debates even if nobody \"won\" and we could still walk away friends. If I stopped trying to prove myself as right and superior all the time.\n\nI learned how to swallow my pride and apologize. And saw that apologizing was actually an act of strength. Not weakness. \n\nSince then I've had much better relationships. When I'm still feeling I'm right I can stop arguing and realize it's a waste to continue and better to just stop the argument before it escalates. Because I would rather have a friendship/relationship than be \"right.\"\n\nYears later I'm now 29. In a long term relationship where we disagree sometimes. Rarely fight. And I willingly own my mistakes and apologize. Because I respect him too much to treat him like I used to behave. And I would rather say I'm sorry (and MEAN it) than drive him off. Because I don't want to hurt him. Or upset him. And instead of always discounting me like my ex, I've found a man who may disagree with me, but LISTENS and DISCUSSES. We talk through our shit instead of try to \"win.\" Because real winning is a resolution, not being \"right.\" And a resolution can be agreeing to disagree but finding a compromise or work around. \n\nUnfortunately my dad can still bring this bad side of me out. So I keep our relationship superficial and limit contact. Because it's too exhausting and upsetting to try to have more with him. But I'll admit I still find it almost impossible to back down with him. But as long as I can limit contact with him and not do that in other relationships, I think I've made a big positive change. Occasionally I hang onto my argument a bit too long, but I back down and apologize for my behavior much more quickly and work to make it not happen again. So I can show that person my apology is not mere words. But a recognition I made a mistake and am working to change.",

My favourite part about the ballet studio argument is that she's also a PARALEGAL and he's lecturing her on getting consent forms. Like, no shit, I'm pretty sure that crossed her mind. \n\nOP: I dated a guy like this off and on for years. I was younger (17-18 and again at 21 then 23). This story always sticks with me. One day after school (I was a senior in high school and he was 2 years older), he was driving me somewhere and asked me how my day was. I told him that we discussed Canterbury Tales, what I thought/liked etc about the topic. At the time, I was planning on majoring in English to write and teach. Out of nowhere, in the middle of me explaining my thought, he said, \"Too bad you'll never use that stuff in the *real* world\" ::awkward, manic, foreveralone laugh:: \"I don't know why you put so much time and effort into that stuff. The things I'M doing with computers is WAY more important....\" etc., etc. \n\nHe'd pull shit like this all the time. Here are a few more that are just too much not to share: \n\n1) He lived with my family my senior year of high school. He had to work the graveyard shift at a job I helped him get (like bought him nice clothes and drove him to the interview). Well, I had to wake up early the day of my high school graduation to do the rehearsal. My alarm went off for this, and it also woke him up. He bitched and moaned the whole time that my alarm woke him up because of his schedule blah blah. He threatened to not come to my high school graduation, that I was horrible. It was awful. School was my thing and I was hella proud of how well I did. \n\nHe didn't come to my grad. He went to work, and I went to my grad night while my mom packed up all his shit and left it outside. \n\n2) Somehow we kept connecting. Low self-esteem and weird timing on both our parts. I look back and EVERY part of the relationship was unhealthy. Anyway, 21. I invited him to a concert and he offered to drive us and two of my friends. He was driving back, 'joke' jerked the wheel and said \"oh we're going to crash!\" and flipped the  truck and it rolled several times. I broke my neck and thoracic spine in 5 places, had to have knee surgery, and am in chronic pain because of it. \n \nAbout a few days out of the hospital while I'm in my Halo brace at my mom's house, BF comes in (I stayed with him because it wasn't HIS fault in my fucked up head) and starts showing me how excited he was about the new car he got for his insurance deal. He brought in the fucking handbook and was telling me about the specs. I told him how I didn't want to hear about his car that he got because he rolled his and broke my fucking neck, and he said I was being selfish and bitchy over something I shouldn't. \n\nHe got mad when I wouldn't get into a car with him to take me to my weekly appointments to get my halo adjusted. Legit thought I was overreacting.\n\n3) Our mutual friend--though I was much closer to him--was hit by a car and died. This was about two months after my accident. I was horrified when I heard, and called BF and asked him to come over to be with me because I was so upset about my friend. He said that he was too tired from work and, \"This accident caused him a lot of stress too.\" I broke up with him after that. \n\nThe times we hooked up after the accident stuff years later was when I was deep into my alcoholism and drug use and used him as a sort of revenge booty call. Not a good time. \n\nMy point is: don't be like me. Don't let some asshole emotionally and mentally abuse you until they physically harm you with their narcissism. He's an asshole and, unless he is willing to change (the apologies you get are promising but must be backed with action), it will only get worse. ",

            "body": "> and then casually asking why I had gone so quiet when we finally arrived at the restaurant where we were going to have dinner.\n\nYou see, I have trouble seeing how advice can help you when this situation is so alien to me, and I wager, to most people. What I mean by this, is that were I in your shoes that day, i would have calmly told him that I had lost my appetite, and that he should please drive me back home. Is it usual for you to continue to put up with him when he not only fails to be an emotional support for you (you know, the absolute bare minimum a partner should do), but actively upsets you?\n\nBecause, and I mean no offense by this, while him being an asshole is absolutely not your fault, it seems you're signalling to him that it's perfectly OK in your relationship for him to treat you that way. You could try and sit him down to talk about the way the treats you all you want, but unless you start acting the part, and stop tolerating his constantly deriding of you, nothing is going to change. That night should have ended right then and there (even though it's quite telling that you mention that you usually don't seek his comforting regarding your work problems), but you let it continue, and of course he continued belittling you at every moment he could. Here's a hint about what happened at that restaurant with the other diners: they weren't merely being annoyed at him acting like a petulant 11 year old, they were very likely wondering why the f you were still sitting there.\n\n> I think he's a little too analytical sometimes\n\nThat is really not the issue here.\n\n>  I admire him for challenging me at times. It keeps things fresh\n\nAnd herein lies your problem. He's not \"challenging you\" but if you can't recognise people disrespecting you deeply when it happens, there's no hope for you to ever have a healthy relationship, even if the gods decided to free you from this person tomorrow. But to say that you **admire** him for it? I'm truly at a loss of words.\n\n> He seems to think that's what I should do every time I feel uncomfortable or shut down by his analyses. If this were a thing that happened less frequently, I would have no issues cutting in and just saying, \"You're doing it again,\" but this happens ALL THE TIME.\n\nWhat's funny here is that him and me are on this topic here. You shouldn't merely cut him down when he's just so blatantly disrespecting you in that car ride to the restaurant; you should end the interaction right there. And it's tremendous to me that you're reaching the conclusion that if you did this, you wouldn't be able to be in a relationship with him, on account of most of your conversations turning into this, and yet, **you don't know what to do**.\n\nJesus Christ. \n\nListen, the rest of the people here are telling you to break up, and they're not wrong at all, bit I'll go one step further: it's extremely preoccupying that you couldn't reach this conclusion on your own with such an extreme example of a thoroughly dysfunctional relationship. You have a problem here, a problem that won't end with this relationship (which absolutely should end, to be perfectly clear). Reached this point I think you really need to look into starting a personal long-term exploratory psychotherapy, and while your post is short, i think I'm not overreacting at all.",

You could try and sit him down to talk about the way the treats you all you want, but unless you start acting the part, and stop tolerating his constantly deriding of you, nothing is going to change. That night should have ended right then and there (even though it&#39;s quite telling that you mention that you usually don&#39;t seek his comforting regarding your work problems), but you let it continue, and of course he continued belittling you at every moment he could. Here&#39;s a hint about what happened at that restaurant with the other diners: they weren&#39;t merely being annoyed at him acting like a petulant 11 year old, they were very likely wondering why the f you were still sitting there.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think he&#39;s a little too analytical sometimes</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is really not the issue here.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I admire him for challenging me at times. It keeps things fresh</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And herein lies your problem. He&#39;s not &quot;challenging you&quot; but if you can&#39;t recognise people disrespecting you deeply when it happens, there&#39;s no hope for you to ever have a healthy relationship, even if the gods decided to free you from this person tomorrow. But to say that you <strong>admire</strong> him for it? I&#39;m truly at a loss of words.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>He seems to think that&#39;s what I should do every time I feel uncomfortable or shut down by his analyses. If this were a thing that happened less frequently, I would have no issues cutting in and just saying, &quot;You&#39;re doing it again,&quot; but this happens ALL THE TIME.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What&#39;s funny here is that him and me are on this topic here. You shouldn&#39;t merely cut him down when he&#39;s just so blatantly disrespecting you in that car ride to the restaurant; you should end the interaction right there. And it&#39;s tremendous to me that you&#39;re reaching the conclusion that if you did this, you wouldn&#39;t be able to be in a relationship with him, on account of most of your conversations turning into this, and yet, <strong>you don&#39;t know what to do</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus Christ. </p>\n\n<p>Listen, the rest of the people here are telling you to break up, and they&#39;re not wrong at all, bit I&#39;ll go one step further: it&#39;s extremely preoccupying that you couldn&#39;t reach this conclusion on your own with such an extreme example of a thoroughly dysfunctional relationship. You have a problem here, a problem that won&#39;t end with this relationship (which absolutely should end, to be perfectly clear). Reached this point I think you really need to look into starting a personal long-term exploratory psychotherapy, and while your post is short, i think I&#39;m not overreacting at all.</p>\n</div>",

I was never that bad, and I've mellowed with age, and with my wife's help.\n\nSo, let me start by telling you a little about where he's coming from. The reason people like us do this is twofold: first, because kicking an idea around between people with different points of view, and different thoughts, can often lead to new insights. I *love* kicking ideas around with my wife, sometimes even deliberately taking the viewpoint opposite hers just so I can here her arguments for it. I've learned a lot that way, and she claims that she's learned some too. \n\nSecondly, I hate to see someone else not considering the alternative. I say it a lot here, but if I have wrong data, I can't make right decisions. I can't easily just stand by and watch my wife draw wrong conclusions, leading her to make wrong decisions in the future. \n\nThirdly, (yes, third point of two) people like us rarely vent, or understand venting. It's just not our way. Even when I *do* vent, I'm always open to hearing advice for how to fix things.\n\nIt's very hard for him to change this, because it's *how he thinks.*\n\nSo, with those things in mind, I recommend the following to deal with him.\n\nFirstly, Go back, and tell him again that sometimes you don't want to analyze everything. Sometimes, you just want to blow off steam. Sometimes, you just want to have a nice, light conversation. Sometimes you just want to hear that he supports you, right or wrong. (this last is a hard sell. Don't worry if he splits hairs) \n\nAfter he claims to understand what you are telling him what you want, what you *need,* tell him that, while he has agreed in the past, he is very bad at actually following through. Set up a \"safe-word\" system. A safe-word is easier to use than the phrase \"Look, I understand that you think you're helping, but you're really, really not. I need you to calm the fuck down, and have a *conversation* not an analysis of the situation.\" He needs to recognize the safe word to mean something like that; he should stop whatever he's saying, and then reenter the conversation on a superficial level, possibly by asking you what it is you need him to do, and then doing it.\n\nIt's gonna change the dynamics of conversation for a while. His \"light conversation\" is gonna suck. he doesn't really know how to do it, and to him it's gonna feel \"fake.\" You'll have to lead him down the garden path for a while, until he gets the hang of it. As well, you need to let him be analytical about some things. That's what *he* needs. But there's a happy medium to be found.\n\nMy wife and I never developed a safe-word for this, but it might have helped if we had. I try to lecture or debate less, she tries to do it more. And I regularly ask her how she wants me to respond to a given prompt.\n\nIf he will not, or cannot accommodate your needs here, then you'll have to decide weather you would rather live with it, or find a new guy.",
