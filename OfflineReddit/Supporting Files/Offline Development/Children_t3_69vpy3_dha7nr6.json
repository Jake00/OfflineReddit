            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>For me, the most difficult thing to grasp is the inconsistency in the grammar. For example, the adjective is curious and the noun is curiosity. The adjective is furious but the noun is suddenly fury or furiousness. Why is it not &quot;furiousity&quot;? Makes no sense. There&#39;s no reliable pattern there, and it can become really confusing. Also, why do some words not need the S at the end to change them into plurals? Flowers, beavers, books, pucks, but then CACTI?? OCTOPI?? Why? It&#39;s just too inconsistent. There&#39;s also a lot of seemingly benign rules that only serve to make English more difficult. For example, why is it that she likes, he likes but they like? What&#39;s the point of the extra S? </p>\n</div>",
