         They in turn are using this algorithm here:
         http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html
         Using the same variable names as the algorthm-
         p is the number of positive ratings,
         n is the total number of ratings,
         confidence refers to the statistical confidence level: pick 0.95 to have 
         a 95% chance that your lower bound is correct, 0.975 to have a 97.5%
         chance, etc. The z-score in this function never changes, so if you don't
         have a statistics package handy or if performance is an issue you can always
         hard-code a value here for z. (Use 1.96 for a confidence level of 0.95.)

         1134028003 is the Unix timestamp for the oldest submission [to Reddit],
         45000 is the number of seconds in 12.5 hours.

         points to be "hot" as something 12.5. hours younger.
