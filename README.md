# OfflineReddit
Barebones Reddit iOS client for downloading posts, comments and later browsing without an internet connection.

Many features that you would expect in a Reddit client are not present and may be added at a future date if I get to them. If you are missing these features I reccommend you use another app in the meantime.
These include:
- Any form of searching (posts / comments / subreddits / users)
- Logging in, posting, commenting
- Following links, even looking at images...
- Live threads
- Viewing other users

Please note this is under heavy development and everything is likely to change.
